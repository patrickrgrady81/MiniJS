I am now just doing things on my own, that course didn't have very good projects, and for sure there were not 30.
<p>
Also, I have days that I cannot work on things due to having twin 2 year olds, so I try when I can.

# OLD
<p>
I am going through the wesbos.com free course on 30 Javascript projects in 30 days.
<p>
I will be trying to do the projects in vanilla Javascript.
<p>
I may try some things like React or Vue just to learn them better.
<p>
I will be doing these projects before I watch the videos to see how he did it.
<p>
If I get stuck I will look things up, but I want a completed project for the most part before I watch the video.
<p>
It says 30 in 30. I realize that some projects may take more than a day and I might need days off, but I am going to continue these projects untl they are done. I will try to make them look nice, so learning css better is another thing I am trying to accomplish with this.
